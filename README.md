## What is this? ##
This is a small demo I made to mess around with Three.js / WebGL and to learn some Javascript / HTML. It visualizes the structures that are formed when spherical particles are dried in evaporating droplets, as reported by [Wang et al.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07600-4).


## What's all that sciency jargon? ##
These structures are called "magic number colloidal clusters", where "colloidal clusters" refers to the fact that these clusters are colloidal i.e. a few micrometers in size and "magic number" refers to the fact that there are specific structures for certain numbers of spheres which are more stable than others. The "Mackay" and "Anti-Mackay" layers are just names for how to build these clusters. Just read the paper if you're interested --- it's open access.
